# Heist

A quick hack to help out an art museum. Not everything need be complicated.

The museum is considering a alternative reality game in conjunction with their educational program. But they ran into a silly technical barrier. 

They need a QR code to go to a sway.cloud.microsoft page, with a particular simple password that is easy to type on a phone -- in this case "moon". 
(The password isn't meant to be secure. It's just an element of the game, with clues in the art.) But Micosoft insists on either no password, or a password that is long and difficult to type.

The quick solution is to have the QR code go to a page that is just a working password prompt, which upon success redirects to the unprotected
page at sway.cloud.microsoft. That's it.
