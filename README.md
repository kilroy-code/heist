# Heist

A quick hack for an art museum.

The museum is considering a alternative reality game in conjunction with their educational program. But they ran into a silly technical barrier. 

They need a QR code to go to a sway.cloud.microsoft page, with a particular simple password that is easy to type on a phone -- in this case "moon". 
(The password isn't meant to be secure. It's just an element of the game.) But micosoft insist on either no password, or a password that is long
and difficult to type.

The quick solution is to have the QR code got to page that is nothing but a working password prompt, which upon success redirects to the unprotected
page at sway.cloud.microsoft. That's it.
